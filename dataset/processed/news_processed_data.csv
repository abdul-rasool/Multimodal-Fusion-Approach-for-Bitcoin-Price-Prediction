2021/1/27 4:04,1,cardano prepares to launch new stablecoin while ada price is on the brink of a moveiohk plans to demonstrate plutus smart contract capabilities using ageusd stablecoin ageusd hopes to stand out from the ethereum backed stablecoins by avoiding cdps cardano is in consolidation but a symmetrical triangle hints at a potential upswing to iohk or input output hong kong the company behind the development of cardano ada is collaborating with the ergo foundation and emurgo to launch the firstever stablecoin asset on the ergo blockchain the new cryptoasset will in the beginning only execute on the ergo blockchain still it will be available on blockchain following the launch of its muchawaited smart contract functionality ageusd brings new design to the stablecoin market the stablecoin asset has been named ageusd and will stand out from the baseline of ethereumbacked smart contracts like dai emurgo is working on introducing a staticoin protocolinspired design the new technology avoids the popular collateralized debt positions cdps fronted by ethereum besides the change was necessitated by vulnerability especially during periods of volatility and congestion on the blockchain emurgo cites the much remembered makerdao liquidations triggered following extreme volatility investors suffered dire losses when the value plunged to zero mainly because of congestion on the blockchain a statement by emurgo stresses that cdps we do not have liquidation events nor the requirement for users to perform transactions to ensure that the liquidations actually work properly rather than allowing a bad actor to steal funds away from the protocol these are inherently vulnerable facets of using cdps for minting stablecoins and as such expose more risk to the will ageusd solve all stablecoin challenges emurgo has with its new stablecoin asset ageusd tried to avoid some inherent problems like the above mentioned the idea is to automate the mathematics of the protocol thus avoiding reliance dynamic transaction postings that can break down in the event of a blockchain however emurgo stated during the ergo summit that the improvements that it has made do not solve all the stablecoin problems yet investors can choose to ride with a highersecurity alternative from what is available in the industry how ageusd protocol functions two different parties interact on the protocol reserve providers and ageusd users the work of reserve providers is to bring ergs native currency to the reserves this allows them to mint every reservecoin is a representative of a portion of ergs that has been locked in the dapp on the other hand ageusd users are required to submit ergs to the dapp reserves but on the contrary they mint ageusd users are allowed to withdraw their ageusd at any time they deem fit and get ergs from the dapp reserves only that the tokens will be subject to the current exchange rate as determined by the ergusd oracle pool reserve providers benefit by redeeming their reservecoins only when ergs price shoots up additionally they earn extra reservecoins when a significant amount of fees is collected on the protocol reserve providers ensure that the value of ageusd is stable however they absorb the shock when whenever the value of the underlying crypto in the reserve drops how does cardano come in ageusd significance in the industry will surpass ergo and deploy on other existing blockchains on the other hand emurgo is subcontracted to create solutions for the cardano blockchain hence the plan to first launch on cardano helps demonstrate the features capabilities and functionalities that can be explored using plutus smart contract programming language combined with ergoscript the development of ageusd was revealed to the cardano community via iohk cto romain twitter account however the announcement was brief and did not mention any timelines it is worth mentioning that cardano is getting closer to the release of the goguen phase which will unlock the smart contract functionality with that in mind we can predict that age usd will debut during the third quarter of around the time iohk will be finalizing on goguen cardano is on the verge of a move cardano is exchanging hands at amid the extended consolidation recovery from the recent dip to has been limited under the price is also under all the three applied moving averages including the sma sma and sma on the chart it is apparent that recovery will be an uphill battle due to the growing overhead pressure however ada is trading within the confines of a symmetrical triangle which hints at a possible move the pattern represents a period of consolidation before a significant move in price it can either result in a breakout or breakdown a breakout occurs above the upper trendline and signifies the beginning of an uptrend on the other hand a breakdown happens if the price slices through the lower trendline the price target for the breakout is exact and measured between the highest and lowest points of the triangle chart for now holding above the lower trendline is key to sustaining the uptrend and pushing cardano closer to the upswing to price action above the moving averages will signify the ability to nurture the uptrend

2021/2/1 14:20,1,individual speculations impact crypto is this the end of the price of bitcoin changed little at the beginning of the working week remaining around the end of last week passed under the banner of for the crypto market first it was wallstreetbets and then the crypto market was rattled by elon musk which led to shortterm jump above but all speculative outbursts usually end the same way down this time was no exception and we are now witnessing bitcoin at roughly the same levels as it was before the speculation nevertheless many who participated in the process and have a good understanding of what is going on earned very well on such fluctuations the cryptocurrencymeme dogecoin doge proves once again that it can well act as a tool for high profits the cohesive actions of the crypto community led to explosive growth of course the price has since remarkably decreased but it is still well above the prepump levels in fact such episodes only worsen the already controversial image of cryptocurrencies emphasizing the extreme speculative component of the crypto price dynamics another unexpected crypto hero was xrp in the last hours xrp has shown growth in recent months the ripple project has often been on the front pages of the crypto media after the news of the sec lawsuit the price of the coin fell sharply the current growth is attributed to response to the allegations the community saw willingness to defend its position as a good sign which led to the recent spike in the background there is also news that has good potential to push cryptocurrencies higher grayscale crypto fund alone has bought btc since the beginning of while miners were able to mine this news can be viewed from several perspectives on the one hand it is obvious that supporting the first cryptocurrency may not cost that much money if we consider these investments in the traditional market context on the other hand we see that the shortage of coins in the market does not lead to a sharp jump in price and the sales of earlier investors cover the demand from large capital at the moment a positive news backdrop often leads to growth with little delay and perhaps this is the case nevertheless bitcoin is holding above bouncing back quickly after corrections and current price levels were tough to imagine just a few months ago with some luck bitcoin has a chance at another attempt to surpass

entire crypto market roared this week lifted by many positive catalysts dominance over the market remained at as altcoins matched rebound after the brief correction over the past couple weeks seen altcoins begin to outperform the king drawing questions of whether had begun this appear to be the case yet this week equity markets were rattled by an army of reddit traders on the community targeting hedge fund shortsellers who themselves had targeted shares of gamestop corp nyse gme in the beginning these reddit traders saw gamestop as an undervalued company with the potential to shift their business model from a brickandmortar retailer to a notable online presence ryan cohen cofounder of chewy inc nyse chwy bought of the company and acquired a total of three new board seats and gamestop was off to the races traders then set their sights on a shortsqueeze where the hedge funds would be forced to buy shares to cover their positions and propel the stock higher as they scramble to find shares to buy the battle between wall street and wallstreetbets escalated from capitalizing an undervalued stock opportunity to trying to wage war against the hedge funds possible this is just the beginning as short interest in gme is still over of the available float because of hedge funds allegedly nakedshorting the company without having access to the borrowed shares a lot of the previous runup has been attributed to a squeeze which is caused by forced buying by market makers forced to buy because a flurry of outofthe money options purchased by retail investors means they have to buy shares to their positions it could end poorly for the hedge funds that covered their short positions yet but they could still escape however reddit traders let them off the hook many wallstreetbets members post about never selling regardless of price action because they specifically want to inflict pain on hedge funds they see it as a form of class warfare one redditor who goes by which is an acronym for his notsafeforwork username posts his daily from his gme afterwards an army of likeminded traders post a chain of still in still followup oaths several brokerage firms including robinhood restricted access to buying gme and other volatile target companies such as amc entertainment holdings inc nyse amc and nokia corp nyse nok crushing demand and sending shares lower this caused public outrage because big institutions were still allowed to trade the shares and many were accused of manipulating the price by buying and selling to each other many have pointed to a significant conflict of interest because the company buying retail order flow from robinhood citadel securities llc injected part of a nearly billion lifeline into melvin capital one of the notable hedge funds short gme with the trust in these brokerages supposedly access to investments fading the case for a decentralized investment mechanism becomes all the more necessary cameron winklevoss cofounder of the gemini crypto exchange tweeted that filed for regular stock brokerage approval doubtless in anticipation that retail investors will look elsewhere additionally elon musk put bitcoin in his twitter bio and it emphasized the rallying cry for financial instruments that be manipulated by rulechanging wall street after he did this robinhood was forced to limit instantbuying cryptocurrency purchases due to the spike of demand this events really showcase some of the strengths of cryptocurrencies and for more on that turn to my colleague alex benfield the events of this week have shown the power that incumbents have over the average amateur investor robinhood shutting down the ability for customers to buy these redditfavored stocks is just the latest example of the downside of centralized exchanges in traditional finance there are no other options for customers to freely trade stocks and in cryptocurrency most people actually use centralized exchanges like coinbase and gemini as well there are major differences right there at that level though the centralized cryptocurrency exchanges talk and coordinate with each other there are many many different exchanges that users can take advantage of across the entire landscape most importantly the main cryptocurrency exchanges have to answer to the same governing bodies as traditional exchanges many traditional brokerage firms require market makers to fill the orders from their retail clients critics point to how this gives market makers potential leverage traditional exchanges usually step in and halt trading of certain assets but the key difference in cryptocurrency trading users have the ability to take advantage of exchanges that step in exchanges that even have the means to intervene and affect the markets because in cryptocurrency users also have the option to use or defi for their investments purposes as well not as userfriendly but all a user needs are an ethereum wallet and an internet connection and they can access a decentralized money market protocol defi by its very nature uses a protocol to settle buys and sells not a centralized body or governing organization and

2021/2/6 14:01,1,here are six technical analysis tips to take advantage of the crypto bull marketwith bitcoin and ethereum prices climbing to record highs things are looking up for the entire cryptocurrency market bitcoin price doubled in less than days after its decisive close above its previous alltime high at now that ethereum has also closed above its last ath investors assume that it might do the same as btc regardless of how one coin performs an interesting observation is that both the most popular tokens have simultaneously turned bullish this development has caused altcoins to surge willy nilly leading to an overall increase in most market value moreover these digital assets are flashing similar bullish setups making higher highs every day hence taking advantage of this bull run is a nobrainer so here are six technical analysis tips to make the most of it what are setups and how to identify them when looking at price charts to understand how a market value behaves it can be observed that multiple patterns or setups that repeat over various time frames develop frequently thus these technical formations provide trading opportunities the most recurring chart patterns are channels wedges triangles too and bottoms and flags chart patterns channelsdevelop when the price starts trading in a rangebound manner between two parallel trendlines all the channel patterns require the price to touch each trendline at least twice as distinct peaks or valleys ascending channels descending channels horizontal channels wedgesare quite similar to the channels except the trendlines converge leading to a price squeeze wedges can also have trendlines that diverge or broaden this identifier sees prices forming a set of higher highs and higher lows in case of a rising wedge or lower highs and lower lows in case of a falling wedge rising wedge falling wedge trianglescan be spotted when prices trade between two converging trendlines as an identifier the price must touch one trendline at least three times the other at least twice forming distinct valleys and peaks symmetrical triangle ascending triangle descending triangle reversalssignify the end or start of rallies and are followed by extreme price movements on the opposite side of the previous trend adam and even rounded bottom flagsare continuation patterns and lead to the further development of the previous trend prices tend to go through a strong breakout in either direction followed by a period of stagnation prices usually consolidate in a downward sloping channel after the initial burst for bull flags in the case of bear flag patterns the consolidation happens in an upward sloping channel while both the flags and pennants are similar the only distinction is the formation of channels as consolidation patterns in flags and symmetrical triangles in pennants flag pennant while there are plenty of chart patterns these are the most commonly seen in the cryptocurrency market marking important areas marking out key levels or areas of interest is the next important step after identifying chart patterns this step helps determine levels where cryptocurrencies might dip or face resistance to set up potential stoploss or takeprofit orders properly price candles contain a lot of useful data a red candle with a large wick above it shows the presence of strong sellers similarly a green candle with a large lower wick represents immense buying pressure when considering the current state of the cryptocurrency market marking out alltime highs is crucial for instance bitcoin formed a local low on january when it pierced through the yearlyopen level at the previous selloff seen on january was mitigated as buyers were able to hold prices at a large bottom wick shows the presence of strong buyers at these price levels therefore the price action between and is called a chart the combination of the first and the second dip can be seen in the chart attached below as a horizontal trendline that crosses both price points can be drawn meanwhile a descending trendline can be drawn around the swing highs chart creating a watchlist the next important step is to add this

2021/3/1 17:17,1,riskon after calm in bond marketsus stocks are rising higher as investors embrace calm in the bond market and look to a brighter future following covid vaccine authorization and robust us manufacturing data last bond market selloff was for growth not inflation and that is helping many traders become comfortable with the idea of a higher stock market and steady rise in treasury yields now that the us has three highly effective covid vaccines expectations for herd immunity at some point in the summer should release a lot of pent up buying power from the us consumer the smallcap trade is back and will likely lead the charge higher as reopening bets return a very strong ism report showed that the manufacturing economy continued its recovery in february the headline reading of was much higher than the consensus estimate of and matched the highest reading since february supply shortages higher commodity prices and higher prices paid explain while managers are still conservative with hiring new people the us economy looks strong with virus mutations being the main risk to the outlook if the next few months do not provide a major reversal in the reopening of the economy the manufacturing sector could run hot asia normally the start of the month of the month would focus on chinese manufacturing data but this time china took a backseat to australia the commitment to yield curve control provided a lot of comfort to investors that the all the other central banks will fall in line the decision to double their bond purchases signaled central banks let the reflation trade get out of control central banks are firmly committed to a low interest rate environment this early in the global economic recovery and that should remain the case for the fed economic data disappointed but many are shrugging that off due to the lunar new year holiday fx the euro held onto losses against the dollar after reports that the ecb reduced their pandemic bondbuying last week despite the skyrocketing move across global bond yields the shortterm outlook for the euro is somewhat bleak now that the uk covid variant is spreading across germany france and italy the us growth exceptionalism could provide a strong some headwinds for currency traders who were looking for a softer dollar europe is ramping up inoculations against covid19 but still trail the us by months the euro will likely struggle in the shortterm to both the dollar and british pound solely on covid vaccinations oil crude prices have shrugged off the strong start following the approval of the covid19 vaccine the us now has three highly effective covid vaccines and if virus variants derail the trajectory of new cases herd immunity could be reached in a few months.also providing some support for oil was betterthanexpected us manufacturing data the data was impacted the deep freeze but surging demand shows how ready this economy is ready to roar once large parts of the country return to prepandemic life the bond market has calmed down and that should stop the dollar from strengthening oil will likely trade rangebound ahead of key meeting which will test the relationship between the saudis and russians the question at hand is how much should increase production in april some softness in chinese economic data albeit likely impacted due to the lunar new year holiday could support the saudis call to remain conservative with ramping up output the saudis hold a lot of the cards since they are the ones that have delivered a surprise extra bpd cut but this is and it could get messy on how they divvy up the share of next month increases in output in addition to the saudis ending their voluntary cut april production could increase anywhere from to bpd this is a live meeting but most energy traders would likely welcome a pullback in crude prices with an improving global covid19 vaccine outlook the energy market is bracing for much higher prices by the end of the year gold gold prices are stabilizing as the bond market selloff appears to be over treasury yields are higher but the skyrocketing pace appears to be over this week is all about fed speak and if they can signal a little concern over the impact of higher yields on the recovery that should give many investors the allclear sign for scaling back into gold rebound is somewhat unimpressive as a broad stock market rally has investors piling back into only stocks gold is not in the clear just yet but the fundamentals appear to be improving the us economy is a couple weeks away from massive relief bill and then ramped discussions over infrastructure spending which will allow the stimulus bowl to overflow bitcoin bitcoin is bouncing back strongly as risk appetite returns to wall street as the bond market selloff appears to be over for now last week surging global bond yields forced many institutional investors to close out some of their best performing trades and for some that was bitcoin bitcoin had a wrath of headlines that are noteworthy but the primary driver still seems to be the calm in the bond market another key story for bitcoin was a new endorsement from a top bank this time it was citi citi put out a research note adding that bitcoin could the currency of choice for international trade the more banks that come out with constructive comments on bitcoin the more likely the speculative bubble will continue to grow an interesting development in china was the announcement that cryptocurrency mining projects in inner mongolia that use up massive amounts of computing power and energy will shut down in two months energy control measures are expected since china failed to meet their targets in less cryptos being mined was another catalyst in this strong start the cryptoverse over the weekend also saw many cryptocurrency traders make the plea to take your cryptos off the exchanges and keep them in your wallet traders normally put their cryptocurrencies on an exchange if they want to cash out wild ride is far from over but it seems another attempt at could be in the cards if the bond rout is truly over bitcoin can survive a

2021/3/3 17:29,1,could the coinbase ipo snap the crypto market out of its bearish imminent ipo of cryptocurrency giants coinbase may be regarded by some as hottest ipo of but its arrival may be significant for galvanizing a crypto market recovering from a jittery start to spring coinbase operates as the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the us and is currently preparing for an initial public offering with talk of a valuation in excess of billion it appears likely that this ipo will be among the biggest of the move is likely to play a role in pushing cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ethereum further towards mainstream adoption just a few months on frompaypal adopting cryptoonto its payments platform but after an end to february that saw btc shed of its value could coinbase going public play a significant role in preventing more bearish patterns from taking place and instead give investors more cause for optimism in digital finance building a billion company in under a decade coinbase began in when former airbnb engineer brian armstrong and goldman sachs trader fred ehrsam joined forces to establish an exchange that would make investing and trading in cryptocurrencies more straightforward and fair armstrong and idea proved to be inspired and today the platform has over43 million retail usersand institutional clients there are also partners based in over countries worldwide while the growth of coinbase has been somewhat more erratic due to the volatility of the cryptocurrency market for the revenues more than doubled to billion and profits came to some million furthermore the assets under custody equate to around million at the time of writing paving the way to mainstream adoption the imminent coinbase ipo will come at a time when the cryptocurrency market has been buoyed by the sustained support of paypal along with significant levels of investment from bothtesla and microstrategy today bitcoin is enjoying a resurgence in popularity following meteoric price rises between december and february however as we head into liquidityhas begun to fall indicating a rise in volatility for the most famous digital currency in the short term in the google trends chart above we can also see that even in an age where bitcoin has smashed its old alltime high from the cryptocurrency is still struggling to generate the same levels of interest as four years ago however as coinbase prepares to go public we may be about to see a greater level of legitimacy added to the world of cryptocurrencies stephen mckeon a finance professor at the university of oregon and a partner at acknowledged the ramifications of coinbase entering the market as a move that will reverberate across the world of crypto will represent the first cryptonative corporation to be listed on a major u.s stock mckeon explained to cointelegraph will be a significant event for the he added finding value in defi links also important to be aware of the amount of money that coinbase holds in its custodial accounts the total value of crypto assets grew from billion to billion in the space of twelve months and is supported in no small part by growth in decentralized finance defi defi represents a range of financial applications that are built on top of ethereum and often take the form of smart contracts protected by blockchain technology not only is coinbase an exchange that facilitates money flowing into the defi market but it also offers users ways to benefit directly from thegrowth of defi too significantly possible for investors to profit from defi simply by holding dai tokens which dishes out dai daily savings rates that are calculated and paid out daily maker the governance token for the system is currently the largest defi network by market and worth about of the entirety of the market pulse as we can see around billion dollars are currently invested in defi a huge increase on the state of play during the early months of furthermore these figures take into count the billion locked into the ethereum beacon contract either the mindboggling sums invested in decentralized finance must be taken seriously when it comes to considering the growth potential of coinbase defi has the potential to use blockchain to provide sophisticated digital financial services that extend way beyond the simple cryptoasset investment strategies of today and coinbase is an exchange moved quickly to accommodate this extremely highpotential market transferring from crypto to ipo investing the imminent arrival of a coinbase ipo may be a tempting proposition for cryptocurrency investors to try their hand at more traditional stocks and shares markets the most straightforward way of investing in an ipo is to go to the company directly however cases of initial public offerings to individual investors is something of a rarity today when it comes to investing largely because companies prefer to deal with institutional clients in order to sell large volumes of shares in a single transaction in contrast selling to the general public can involve sporadic investments on a much smaller scale which results in costing the company more than it would by simplydealing directlywith the institutional arena despite this there are companies out there that can allow individuals to participate in various ipos for instance freedom finance corp frhc has aplatform thatallows individuals to apply to participate in an ipo the threshold is though alternatively more traditional companies likefidelityalso offer participation but with a higher threshold of either or in household assets depending on the ipo itself however yet no official date of when the ipo will take place capitalizing on a symbiotic relationship with bitcoin despite heavily representing the defi market revenue largely comes from just two of its assets bitcoin and ethereum for btc and eth represented and of assets on the platform respectively thefiling itself acknowledgesthat demand for these cryptoassets declines and is not replaced by new demand for crypto assets our business operating results and financial condition could be adversely despite institutional interest continually rising around bitcoin the cryptocurrency has suffered an uncertain start to a springtime been punctuated by some losses in trading volume it may just be that a positive coinbase ipo could provide a catalyst for more mainstream crypto acceptance that kicks btc out of its bearish slumber while generating a strong enough rally to see coinbase hit the ground running when it hits the market the listing of coinbase provides the trading platform and wider cryptocurrency industry with its first taste of wall street recognition in a landscape still in its

not a few who value that bitcoin are still in the middle of the upward path each has their own arguments in which each party exhibits a rational approach based on principles but the approach to the principles may not be enough maybe another approach is needed from the point of view of organized societies wealth in any form is not just a tool for buying and selling products it is a means of exercising power but it is also an important means of revision the need over the centuries has created the currency which today confirms the presumption of the power of wealth currency is based on a completely intangible concept which is trust a proof of trust in currencies is that they are usually printed in digital form to be precise out of the total world wealth expressed in currencies in physical form of coins and notes there is a percentage of only the remaining is mere numbers registered in the proprietary banking software which is responsible for guarding against malicious attacks on banking software so global money is nothing more than digital capital guarded by financial institutions and governments through the central banks this is a reality that has been valid for decades until recently because in the last decade this reality seems to be reviewing money in the form of currencies we use is based as we said on our trust in a bank or a government but this confidence is shaken from time to time currency devaluations or the devaluation of money due to inflation are typical examples unlike currency precious metals due to their rarity and extremely high production difficulty are universally accepted are independent of trust in governments or banks and are certainly not at risk of inflationary attacks these special characteristics of precious metals have always made them attractive and therefore functioned as a means of storing wealth their disadvantage however is that they could not be used in everyday transactions but the recipe for their attractiveness existed and exists rarity production acceptance independence all that remained and remains is to find a way to implement it the way of implementation was found in digital technology where more than a decade ago the digital cryptocurrency was created a currency that could be produced by anyone but should be available in relatively small pieces so as not to lose its value a currency that serves an opensource payment system which is managed by decryption methods a transparent currency with an open digital register in which anyone can see balances and transactions which are made at any time a currency that decentralizes money rejecting all forms of dependence an acceptable currency as it is inviolable which is ensured by the blockchain technology on which it is based and developed there are many critics of this new currency each of them makes logical arguments against it on a practical level their most powerful arguments include the enormous amount of power consumption required to extract new cryptocurrencies as well as the technical view that blockchain technology offers finite limits to the service of a global currency in a more theoretical but essential dimension critics of cryptocurrencies claim that they are unable to quantify the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as well as their contribution to economic growth in essence the failure to quantification shakes the fundamental principles because the principles are what help us to quantify the purpose of a product in this case the quantify of the purpose of currencies this weakness is significant but sometimes in economic and social history there is something more important these are the values principles are different from values principles quantify the purpose that a product serves that is they quantify the purpose that a currency serves on the other hand values define the relationship of the product with the purpose it serves that is the relationship of the currency with the purpose it serves in times of great change like the one we have been experiencing in recent decades values override principles and this is because when much is changed and even more are born like the new products then it is the values that play the leading role in fact the great changes and the new products redefine values as they revise the relation of a product such as the relation of currency to the purpose that serves so yes it is significant to be quantified the purpose which a currency serves but today in an era of redefinition it is more important to review the relationship of currencies with the purpose they serve

2021/3/5 7:56,1,bitcoin the battle between principles and valuesbitcoin is still trading close to there are many who estimate that the upward cycle has come to an end respectively however there are not a few who value that bitcoin is still in the middle of the upward path each has its own arguments in which exhibit a rational approach based on principles but the approach to the principles may not be enough maybe another approach is needed from the point of view of organized societies wealth in any form is not just a tool for buying and selling products it is a means of exercising power but it is also an important means of revision the need over the centuries has created the currency which today confirms the presumption of the power of wealth currency is based on a completely intangible concept which is trust proof of trust in currencies is that they are usually printed in digital form to be precise out of the total world wealth expressed in currencies in the physical form of coins and notes there is a percentage of only the remaining is mere numbers registered in the proprietary banking software which is responsible for guarding against malicious attacks on banking software so global money is nothing more than digital capital guarded by financial institutions and governments through the central banks this is a reality that has been valid for decades until recently because in the last decade this reality seems to be reviewing money in the form of currencies we use is based as we said on our trust in a bank or a government but this confidence is shaken from time to time currency devaluations or the devaluation of money due to inflation are typical examples unlike currency precious metals due to their rarity and extremely high production difficulty are universally accepted are independent of trust in governments or banks and are certainly not at risk of inflationary attacks these special characteristics of precious metals have always made them attractive and therefore functioned as a means of storing wealth their disadvantage however is that they could not be used in everyday transactions but the recipe for their attractiveness existed and exists rarity production acceptance independence all that remained and remains is to find a way to implement it the way of implementation was found in digital technology where more than a decade ago digital cryptocurrency was created a currency that could be produced by anyone but should be available in relatively small pieces so as not to lose its value a currency that serves an opensource payment system which is managed by decryption methods a transparent currency with an open digital register in which anyone can see balances and transactions which are made at any time a currency that decentralizes money rejecting all forms of dependence an acceptable currency as it is inviolable which is ensured by the blockchain technology on which it is based and developed there are many critics of this new currency each of them makes logical arguments against it on a practical level their most powerful arguments include the enormous amount of power consumption required to extract new cryptocurrencies as well as the technical view thfat blockchain technology offers finite limits to the service of a global currency in a more theoretical but essential dimension critics of cryptocurrencies claim that they are unable to quantify the usefulness of cryptocurrencies as well as their contribution to economic growth in essence the failure to quantification shakes the fundamental principles because the principles are what help us to quantify the purpose of a product in this case the quantify of the purpose of currencies this weakness is significant but sometimes in economic and social history there is something more important these are the values principles are different from values principles quantify the purpose that a product serves that is they quantify the purpose that a currency serves on the other hand values define the relationship of the product with the purpose it serves that is the relationship of the currency with the purpose it serves in times of great change like the one we have been experiencing in recent decades values override principles and this is because when much is changed and even more are born like the new products then it is the values that play the leading role in fact the great changes and the new products redefine values as they revise the relation of a product such as the relation of currency to the purpose that serves so yes it is significant to be quantified the purpose which a currency serves but today in an era of redefinition it is more important to review the relationship of currencies with the purpose they serve if we accept that we are in such a period then let us focus more on values and less on principles because so we may realize that cryptocurrencies and their respective innovative products essentially revise the relationship of the purpose they serve and that affects their quantification criteria until this process is over seize the opportunities and expose yourself wisely

held during the financial woes of suggests a tough trading week ahead since i last wrote venus has moved from morning to evening star as venus has strong planetary association with finance this too suggests a shift in tempo which should be apparent as early as this week young technical stocks may be hit badly with many requiring extra capital to survive as explained in a previous letter the two planets saturn and uranus are at right angle position to one another as viewed from earth three times in in february june and december if history repeats then loss of index value following one or all of these aspects is probable the question has always been which of these three occasions would there be most marked it is of course possible that these last few days of march will see reaction to the downside but perhaps more likely that extreme movement will come at the end of the year the heliocentric aspect occurs in october is followed by a mars opposition signalling a top and then a lunar eclipse by then the nodes will have moved into the finance orientated signs of taurusscorpio perhaps from midnovember and slightly ahead of the last saturnuranus aspect that losses will be most marked another key date that said research suggests that when there is planetary emphasis on the mutable signs that there is a tendency to the downside if the forthcoming lunar eclipse on may mirrors that of then again we should expect a downward slide in those last few days of may these events present buying opportunities most likely in sectors that have only recently developed crypto and blockchain industries are the most obvious examples please note that if you purchased the astrobitcoin forecast that i will be sending an updated pdf file at the new moon on april this follows a presentation on crypto currencies that i will give to the mayo school on april see below opportunity the advantage of studying planetary cycles is that we have the possibility to both decode the past and assess how planetary vibration might affect our future taking into account the ingresses of outer planets in the coming years i am interested in those companies seeking to clear up the plastic millions if not billions of ppe clothing have been discarded these items could choke the planet much as covid is choking those who have succumbed to this awful virus longerterm with pluto moving into air sign aquarius and uranus moving into gemini we should all be interested in minimising air pollution and perhaps consider investing in those companies offering solutions pandemic it is an interesting fact that for many months now most of the regular planets have been contained within of the zodiac with the exception of those days in the month when the moon has opposed each of these planets the general cosmic shaping has been that of the bowl many of us have been confined within this with some trying to scramble out of the sides and others endlessly or so it seemed pushed back inside that planetary shaping will dissolve temporarily this summer to return later in the year travel restrictions then may be with us for a little longer but will surely benefit companies like zoom skype gotomeeting etc another interesting feature of the present is that again as viewed from earth all the regular planets are in forward motion suggesting that the desire to is great the next planetary retrograde come until midmay and coincides with arrival in pisces without wishing to be negative and despite promise of new horizons i think we especially in the uk need to be prepared for our clipped travel wings to stay that way a little longer saturn brings restrictions research living in this has had one major advantage it has offered ample time for research as always i am indebted to the amazing developers at optuma URL though this is primarily a programme for technical analysts the astro functions are quite wonderful of course it comes as no real surprise that there is a difference between the way in which e.g the index responds to planetary alignments versus the taiwan index decoding each and gaining understanding of their respective is proving fun though as i will show during various presentations this year see below for full list this research delayed the sunmars masterclass which was due to be recorded last week the wait will i am sure be worthwhile you can though purchase

2021/3/30 3:32,1,structured crypto deposits the workings of a new investment product that protects against risks of market dropsstructured investment products or sips have become commonplace in the financial sector these tools are excellent for investors with specific needs and can yield acceptable returns a similar trend is now appearing in the cryptocurrency space making digital assets a lot more attractive the purpose of structured investment products financial services and products need to keep evolving and changing to accommodate individual users and needs as demand for exposure to different and varied financial vehicles becomes more outspoken financial institutions shift their attention to structured investment products or sips rather than providing a single investment these types can meet investor needs through a customizable product mix it is not uncommon to see derivatives in the sip basket unlike other investment opportunities a derivative can provide exposure to different types of sectors it is a viable solution for hedge funds organizations or even retail clients the scope and complexity of a structured investment product can vary from one user to the next it all comes down to risk appetite any investment can incur financial losses if mishandled or a sudden market shift occurs depending on risk appetite it may be better to have a complex or straightforward structured investment product options to explore include fixed income markets and derivatives both of which are common concepts in the sip segment what makes a sip intriguing is how it provide traditional payment features there are no periodic coupons or final principal instead invests opt for nontraditional payoffs derived directly from the performance of the underlying the upside is that even if the underpinning asset decrease in value investors will still get their initial deposit back afterward a few examples although most people are aware of this vehicle there is an option to gain exposure to certain stock indices an investment vehicle tracking the stock performance can serve as a base for a structured investment product as the goes up the structured product will increase in value if it goes down in value by the time the product matures the investor will step get their initial deposit back the structured product will often be based on a cd or bond with a call option under the hood a very appealing investment option is created as the initial capital is protected while providing upside profit potential as is often the case such a service comes at a price and there will be fees to contend with in some cases those fees may negate entire profit which can be rather problematic benefits and drawbacks similar to other investment options on the market today a sip has both benefits and drawbacks the main benefits include a better way to diversify portfolio principal protection relatively low volatility and a chance at achieving more significant returns how many of these benefits will apply depends on the way the sip is structured on the other hand a sip is more complex than investing in assets directly triggering some additional risks while banks try to offer sips to as many people as possible they sometimes lack transparency regarding the fees that may apply additionally not every provider will let investors exit their sip before it matures despite these drawbacks the concept of structured investment products is now gaining ground among cryptocurrency enthusiasts a somewhat surprising development although diversification is equally crucial in that segment why sips can benefit crypto enthusiasts unlike the traditional structured investment product a cryptocurrencyoriented sip will not be issued by a bank or other centralized provider the decentralized finance industry has given birth to many different investment vehicles that require no intermediaries or approval to access structured investment products are a logical addition to this growing collection of tools and services to catalyze global crypto adoption by creating products that replicate cryptoassets or an index of different cryptoassets mainstream investors can gain broader exposure to this industry additionally all custodial and trading aspects are left to these issuer creating a nearly automated investment solution the first company that offered such a service was gekkoin their structured crypto deposits offer up to guarantee of profit or money back if the bitcoin price were to drift lower investors can expect a return from per annum through these structured deposits making it more appealing than keeping money in a savings account as the cryptocurrency industry continues to grow new investors need to be attracted by providing an option such as structured deposits with capital protection more investors can make their way to this industry without risking their funds vehicles like these negate negative volatility yet still provide a return on investment if the volatility results in a bull market closing thoughts when popular vehicles from traditional finance make their way to the cryptocurrency industry exciting things are bound to happen structured investment products can appeal to many types of investors regardless of their net worth more importantly it provides a way for investors to diversify their portfolios with less traditional financial vehicles and without any additional risk for now it remains unclear how popular these cryptooriented sips will turn out to be it is a welcome addition to the evolving industry especially due to the institutional appeal these products can have bringing cryptoassets to a much broader and varied audience is essential if this industry is to enter mainstream adoption levels

2021/4/4 14:53,1,looking for a reliable hardware wallet in days as the crypto market is flourishing in a continuous bull run getting harder and harder to predict the top of this trend as btc and other crypto prices are continuously climbing the issue of safekeeping for cryptocurrencies is becoming increasingly relevant and the place where cold wallets come to mind what is a hardware crypto wallet hardware crypto wallets often called or are physical devices for keeping your digital assets unlike the software wallets which essentially are downloaded programs and either way keep your funds encrypted on the web the hardware ones cryptos on the external drive uncontrollable to none of your electronic device thanks to the latter feature your assets stay out of danger if your computer gets compromised as the fraudsters are still unable to access the private keys and passwords unless of course kindly duplicated them on the hacked device please never do this the funds kept on a hardware wallet are typically managed through a usb connection with a computer via a brand app provided by the manufacturer the encrypted data itself never gets connected with the internet thus any pc viruses can not compromise it choosing a hardware wallet several things thatdraw attention once you are about to buy a hardware device to store your cryptos cold you should understand which aspects of the future device could be crucial the first and the only undoubted criteria are security which is undoubtedly the point all hardware wallets are about the rest depends on your user experience exploitation intensity and many other reasons down to color preferences and the software installed on your computer have a quick overview of the main ones security although all hardware wallets are designed to focus on safety there are several different features to consider before making your choice the first point worth keeping an eye on when it comes to the software design is how your device generates the private keys the most popular feature among the market competitors is the seed generation method which most manufacturers implement including trezor and ledger this technology is highly secured and has no real threats except the seed phrase gets lost within the hierarchy deterministic structure as are the same seed accesses several wallets kept within the device although this seem to be a problem at all while you are ensured the device you own is original and uncompromised and its backups are stored safely for nondeterministic wallets that generate your private keys independently from each other for extra security the most significant point for concern is different as each wallet is encrypted with its unique seed have to keep them all remembered not to lose access to your funds for instance bc vault one the rare example of a nonhd hardware device resolves this by storing its backups on an sd card or paperqr in an encrypted way design portability although the vital point of owning hardware crypto storage is extra protection for your digital funds there are several other essential things you should think over before choosing one the portability and general conditions you will use it in also matter these days the hardware devices present on the market are pretty distinct so better to prioritize the main usage characteristics you are looking for for say if you focus on the compactness and mean constantly carrying your hardware storage in your pocket you should think of a bank cardlike device that will never take too much space and perfectly fits both your billfold and purse anyway better take care of the way your device is kept this sort of hardware device basically imply a usb connection with a pc relying on bluetooth or even nfc technology instead here are just several examples of bank cardlike hardware wallets coolwallet s butlox ultimate or good oldfashioned veteran ledger unplugged which is currently out of the sale those looking for a usbconnected compact device may also find a couple of options available including opendime bitcoin stick and the bitbox lineup wallets in case the display size of your future wallet also matters no lack in such kind of alternatives for say latest wallet called model t is equipped with a bright fullcolor touchscreen which turns out to be an excellent solution for confident device management if you are yet about looking for even bigger things draw attention to devices like opolo cosmos bc vault one or flagship cobo vault which looks nearly like a real tablet with a touchscreen and a fingerprint sensor on board pricing when it comes to pricing most of the hardware currently available on the market fall in the range of to usd per device with several costumed flagship devices charged above usd as soon as this review is intended for an average crypto enthusiast true to say that the vast majority of devices are offered at closely comparable prices therefore hard to say whether any point to count every single dollar while choosing a device that will not only serve you for at least several years but also guarantee your safety as well as convenient management over them despite the points above those who keep looking for a bargain might consider ledger nano s or trezor one both priced below usd although these are not the most cuttingedge devices they are still deemed reliable devices to start your hardware wallet experience device origin and shipping probably the last but indeed not the last thing you should consider while choosing your first or maybe the following hardware wallet once chosen the variant that seems to be the perfect match per your goals and the user experience your plans still could be affected by the harsh reality the issue is that your region could be out of the delivery zone or what is even more common the shipping time could be far much longer than expected the best way to prevent a problem is researching carefully the information on the website and related forums like reddit bitcointalk and so on also not forget about the option of connecting directly with the producing company in case you have any reasons to doubt that your purchase could get stuck on the way to you please always remember that only devices delivered unharmed straight from the manufacturer could guarantee your digital proper security never rely on dubious resellers if the producing company does not officially approve them and especially you dare to buy any wallets from private sellers in this case you risk getting a pig in a poke with harmed or uploaded malicious software that could steal your private keys and therefore your funds as a next step conclusion these are just several aspects worth your attention regarding the hardware wallets for bitcoin and other cryptos please note that no undoubtedly best device as the market is full of offers and your final choice has to be made among the other things based on the criteria mentioned in this article manage your funds wisely and keep hodl the author is not connected and has no financial interest in promoting any of the products mentioned above

2021/4/16 3:59,1,how is ethereum tackling its gas fee the average transaction fee on the ethereum blockchain hitting almost on february pretty clear that a problem to be addressed one thing for a defi investor chasing a high yield on a lending protocol or a whale moving around large amounts of eth but what about regular people trying to move smaller amounts transact in erc20 tokens like stablecoins erc721 tokens like nfts or dapp developers trying to onboard new users with fees like that simply being priced out of the equation blockchain games make no sense with such lengthy processing times and other blockchain applications become unnecessarily expensive to use true that the average transaction fee has come down a fair bit since its february highs currently at around but still payment providers like paypal are providing better rates in some cases hardly the promise of crypto moreover gas fees have decreased in tandem with ether price as soon as it gets ready for another upward rally the cost of interacting with the ethereum network will soar along with it how is ethereum tackling the issue even before the rush on collectible cat game cryptokitties clogged the ethereum network in its scaling limitations were wellunderstood in several scaling solutions had already been brought up from zksnarks now called roll ups to and plasma in yet the most sustainable solution to pressing issues lies in its transition to a proof of stake pos blockchain that will use sharding to break down large amounts of data into smaller pieces eth still some ways off until then ethereum is working on improvements cofounder vitalik buterin has openly committed to resolving scaling issues as quickly as possible by using the layer solution optimistic roll ups speaking on the tim ferris podcast earlier this month he enthused that roll ups would allow ethereum to scale by a factor of you have rollups but you do not have sharding you still have factor he said still have the ability for the blockchain to go up to somewhere between and transactions a second depending on how complex these transactions no date for roll ups has been cemented yet but likely to be the dominant topic of conversation for ethereum scaling in the midterm in fact with the upcoming launch of this layer solution by optimism slated for this month many large defi players have decided to integrate it in their protocols including uniswap and synthetix this could make the biggest dent yet into network congestion and high fees the upcoming berlin upgrade on april could also have some effect on the reduction of gas fees network congestion may not be immediately relieved though ethereum has some major structural changes to undergo before it can solve its problems the solutions in question may be enough to patch ethereum and the thousands of dapps built on it through to eth but they may not after all ethereum operate in a vacuum there is plenty of competition heating up starting to propose real functioning alternatives to ethereum even with the largest developer community in the space and the most dapps complacency can be a killer more efficient versions of stablecoins already seeing fast robust and stable opensource proof of stake blockchains like algorand and tron providing traders with the chance to transact with stablecoins like usdt and usdc on their networks by running the algorand versions usdca and usdta of either of these two stablecoins instead of their erc20 versions for example users especially highfrequency traders looking to avoid the volatility of cryptocurrencies like ether and bitcoin can save a lot of time and money algorand can process transactions per second tps allowing for muchneeded speed and throughput compared to current tps fees are also nexttonothing at around regardless of the size and beyond this massive benefit for stablecoin traders developers wanting to use the algorand standard asset asa protocol can create new tokens to use inside their dapp running on a faster network of course blockchains like algorand may not have the same network effect as ethereum but if solutions come quickly not out of the question that migrations of dapps from ethereum begin to become more common evmcompatibility ethereum is also facing more serious competition from other players in the blockchain space binance smart chain bsc for example has started to make a dent even headon challenging ethereum with one popular dapp in particular venus xvs however not all developers will want to accept the tradeoff that building on bsc involves binance smart chain still relies on many centralized elements in order to offer lowcost transactions okexchain in contrast has been designed with decentralization at its core as a fully opensource public chain with a focus on trading above all it also offers extremely high throughput and upon completion of its phased rollout evmcompatibility as well this will be extremely attractive especially to decentralized financial applications and dexs that can join the first tradingcentric public chain and migrate their dapps from ethereum to trade transact and develop at a fraction of the cost blockchains with evmcompatibility especially ones with a high focus on decentralization will challenge dominance and offer developers traders and all network users more choice they will also force the incumbents to solve their scaling issues and offer users the experience they deserve which is a net positive for all participants in the space

2021/4/17 19:23,1,is bitcoin becoming the google of crypto as btc market cap nears new zschaepitz a market analyst at welt emphasized that bitcoin btc is nearing the valuation of google as it heads toward trillion in market capitalization.currently as of april the market cap of bitcoin is hovering at around trillion as the entire valuation of the crypto market remains comfortably above trillion.what is the similarity between bitcoin and similarity between bitcoin and google that zschaepitz pointed out is that both have dominance in their respective sectors.bitcoin vs google market cap source bloomberg holger zschaepitzbitcoin has the strongest network effect in the cryptocurrency market accounting for more than of the global cryptocurrency market.google has dominance over the search engine market and has a massive share of the videosharing and streaming sector with its ownership of youtube.zschaepitz exponential age thanks to network effects the value of bitcoin is increasing and has almost reached the stock market value of a classic network share google which is worth bitcoins dominance over the cryptocurrency market would be sustained over the long term remains in question due to the rising valuation of ethereum and layerone blockchain networks.however the major difference between bitcoin and the rest of the market is that there is clear institutional demand for btc as a store of value due to its network computing power and therefore trustlessness.hence investors generally view bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and the de facto reserve cryptocurrency.in january jpmorgan strategists wrote that bitcoin could rise to as high as as it competes against gold as a store of value.the strategists long term upside based on an equalization of the market cap of bitcoin to that of gold for investment purposes is conditional on the volatility of bitcoin converging to that of gold over the long term the reason is that for most institutional investors the volatility of each class matters in terms of portfolio risk management and the higher the volatility of an asset class the higher the risk capital consumed by this asset financial institutions are also acknowledging the importance of bitcoins network effect and its dominance in the crypto market as the goto store of value.where is the price of bitcoin heading from the foreseeable future the sentiment around bitcoin remains mixed after the public listing of coinbase.following the listing of coin there is speculation that it could mark the top of the crypto market.however most onchain data and market indicators such as funding rates do not necessarily suggest that a blowoff top is near.for instance popular crypto trader known as crypto capo read many people saying that funding is high not only in bitcoin but also in altcoins this is we compare the current funding levels with those of the top of we see that they are low levels taking into account that the price is three times higher also the current trend is led by spot trading and not by key onchain metrics also suggest that bitcoin price is still far from the bull market top on the contrary btc price may easily reach six figures as forecast on the popular stocktoflow model and even go as high according to bloomberg

2021/4/18 14:20,1,gacha systems and game theory can transform ntfs for the betterthe ongoing craze surrounding nonfungible tokens continues unabated for all intents and purposes whereas the first wave of nfts was considered a fad it is evident that projects and offerings are evolving big things are on the horizon for this industry and i be more excited for it nfts just about the money many onlookers perceive the nft industry as a new hype where lots of money is thrown around for collectibles and digital art with no value it is understandable where that vision comes from as nfts may not make much sense at first glance why would anyone want to collect or other items that reside on the blockchain if they can be screenshotted and copied that way in reality those are the examples of nfts that will attract media headlines in my opinion we can find the real innovation in this space elsewhere it is not about what is visible on the surface but about the deeper meaning and potential of nfts with so many companies and developers entering this space in recent months it is a matter of time until big things will occur there is a lot of potential to unlock in the nft space rather than focusing on traditional collectibles or even crypto art this concept can be applied to many other ideas i look forward to more projects bridging the gap between decentralized finance and nfts or the projects that allow for nft minting and trading within and outside of their ecosystem those are the solutions that will bring more mainstream attention to onfungible tokens to not just focus on how much is going around combining different facets when an nft ecosystem is created it is essential to look at all the possibilities it may unlock combining different facets into one broader project is something i am personally a fan of while we can all appreciate the collection aspect of nfts it is interesting to see how creators develop new combinations one project catching my attention combines game theory with art collecting gacha and anime as a fan of gachapon where you receive random rewards from vending machines the concept immediately appealed to me similar to how one may be surprised when they open up a surprise egg nfts should maintain an aura of mystery and surprise doki doki chainbinders provides that solution it is home to original ip and characters with their own backgrounds and elements from various games anime series and so forth all aspects are gamified on the marketplace by providing instant liquidity and actual value for every nft created moreover the introduction of game theory ensures that many people can help contribute to these new nft projects for chainbinders a team of over individuals contributed to this project further confirming how everyone can play an integral part in taking this ecosystem to a whole new level to play the chainbinders gacha machine users need hyperinflationary bnd tokens which recently raised over million on the first day of its token sale through their liquidity generation event under the hood i think it great to see projects explore the creation of nft collections backed by a reserve pool of ethereum using this pool allows teams to explore options such as token buybacks and burns creating reserve pools and so forth this is just one example of how complex one can make an nft ecosystem yet still keep it fun through gamification and art collection aspects closing thoughts there is a lot to like about nonfungible tokens when the overarching concept makes sense the time has come to look beyond collectible cats on the blockchain that serve very limited purposes teams capable of incorporating lore and elements from other industries manga movies tv shows and so forth will in my opinion have a much better chance at succeeding longterm to attract users and investors they need to see nfts that resonate with them the first generation of nonfungible tokens focuses on rich rather than utilizing this technology to its full potential when teams start to build more appealing nft ecosystems exciting things are bound to happen it is pertinent for this industry to cater to people who may not be involved in cryptocurrencies today to do so the nft offerings need to strike a chord with onlookers making them willing to take the plunge teams can apply several methods for this purpose yet the game theory and gacha system will always be one of my favorites

selloff event bitcoin has spent the past two days slowly recovering its losses what presents five factors to consider as a new trading week gets underway and cryptocurrency holders across the board nurse their wounds.stocks primed for up only short macro picture is fairly stable in asia and europe with united states markets yet to open a mixed picture greeted investors at the open but volatility has been broadly absent with only oil showing signs of more pronounced weakness.as such little impact on bitcoin is to be expected from equities moves these forecast to continue building on record highs in the coming weeks.russel chesler head of investments and capital markets at the australian branch of cryptofriendly investment manager vaneck captured the mood in a note quoted by current view is that with shortterm interest rates set to remain low for the medium term and our expectation that earnings will continue to increase it is unlikely that the increase in longterm interest rates will trigger an equity market wrote.coronavirus concerns still linger despite surge higher with more reported official cases last week than ever before worldwide.economic responses continue to vary with a patchwork of openings and closings characterizing attempts to control the outbreak.bitcoin recovers from crashin bitcoin circles the main talking point naturally remains the weekend events which saw a sudden cascade of selling send down by in a matter of minutes.bouncing at just above the crash echoed several similar events this year and bitcoin managed to regain around of its lost ground within candle chart bitstamp source tradingviewresponses however are split between those who consider the volatility usiness as more conservative voices calling time on the latest bull run.as cointelegraph reported suspicions are focusing on a chinese power blackout hitting hash rate as well as rumored legal action by u.s regulators against unnamed financial institutions related to money laundering.in his own breakdown of what happened popular statistician willy woo highlighted both china and skittish moves by futures investors as contributing to the just saw the single largest drop in mining hash rate since nov the hash rate on the network essentially halved causing mayhem in btc price as it crashed he told twitter followers.in a sign that the future could see fresh sustained upside woo reiterated the an onchain metric the spent transaction output ratio sopr showing that longterm investors will likely soon stop selling onchain sopr metric near a full reset a classic buy the dip added n simple terms profit taking by longer term investors is completing very little sell power left unless investors want to sell at a loss from their entry price unlikely in a bull point higherit not just sopr a whole range of bitcoin network indicators and fundamentals are buoying even as remains below even february high of woo and others particularly important are the transfer of funds to investors who have traditionally hodled not sold another classic trait of bitcoin rise in recent months.bitcoin liquid supply change chart showing transfers to strong hands source willy stronghanded holders are buying this dip in the last hours over bitcoin became illiquid a analyst william clemente added illiquid supply increase is not only just dip buyers with no history of selling but partially accumulation from months ago of which those wallets have just crossed the illiquid threshold for this around of the total available bitcoin supply has been active above something which woo says is confirming its status as a trilliondollar asset at around bitcoin market cap becomes a solid dip happened while unprecedented numbers of new users are arriving onto the network per day theres been a retail influx in the last additionally noted with total wallet numbers nearing million difficulty takes care of miner woesa closer look at hash rate which at one point dipped by almost half shows that a recovery in line with price is underway.according to rough estimates from onchain monitoring resource blockchain bitcoin network hash rate is already back above exahashes per second having broken through the barrier for the first time in history last week.bitcoin hash rate chart source blockchainminers leaving the network due to power problems leads to bitcoin network difficulty decreasing to incentivize more to come online.further confirmation that the weekend issue was firmly temporary comes from difficulty forecasts in two when it next adjusts difficulty will only drop by around a modest move which could yet be cancelled out altogether as miners return.this balance between hash rate and difficulty is arguably the most important aspect of bitcoin one which allows it to govern itself and preserve security and functionality regardless of sudden events impacting network participants.chinese central bank praises bitcoin and stablecoinsin another unanticipated event which is arguably yet to be fully appreciated by the market china has given an unprecedented stamp of approval to cryptocurrency as an nvestment at a conference organized by cnbc li bo deputy governor of china central bank the people bank of china pboc broke ranks to validate both bitcoin and regard bitcoin and stablecoin as crypto assets these are investment said.the comments are surprising as despite being a center for bitcoin mining activity china has had a blanket ban in place on trading and transacting in cryptocurrencies since september country that bans bitcoin eventually reverses that ban you simply cannot be competitive in the century economy without edwards founder of investment firm capriole responded hina is playing chess the last days have made very clear they still

2021/4/19 11:25,1,crypto is cracking here is a way to trade itcrypto cracks over the weekend offer a pairs trade idea long btcusd vs coin stock coin stock grossly overvalued insiders sell most of their allowed holdings the pairs trade provides a hedged bet on correction in sector crypto cracks over the weekend offer a pairs trade idea this weekend the crypto market experienced what many in the media ara calling black sunday as a variety of instruments including bitcoin and ethereum dropped nearly before recovering somewhat at the start of the trade the price action in crypto has stabilized but the rebounds have been less that impressive with bitcoin only up about on the day still trading of all time highs this wild price action in crypto is typical as the asset has the highest volatility of any major investment instrument in the world and the action this weekend may have simply been a quick profittaking move after a relentless rally but if this is indeed the start of a deeper correction in the whole sector then there could be several ways to play the move without the need to guess the top long btcusd vs coin stock one way to mitigate some of the volatility risk is to construct a pairs trade that would go long btcusd and short coin stock at current prices the pairs trade would require a ratio of one bitcoin unit to units of coin in order to establish an equal position on both sides last week the biggest crypto exchange coinbase went public at a whopping valuation of billion and actually rose in value to billion there are many reasons to believe that coin stock is grossly overvalued but the underlying thesis for the pairs trade is that the price of coin stock will be highly correlated to the price action of bitcoin and will collapse if bitcoin tumbles as well coin stock grossly overvalued coinbase is the largest crypto exchange in the world and as such enjoys rentier profits from both its size and its dominance of what is essentially a highly inefficient market to get an idea of the massive transaction fees that coinbase collects one needs to understand that an average transaction in bitcoin on the coinbase exchange would cost an investor about in commissions not including the bidask fees in comparison a similar stock transaction would be essentially free to the investors excluding bidask fees and a similar transaction in forex would cost a dime excluding bid ask fees the massive profit margins that exist in crypto dealing are due to the fragmentation and the volatility of the market and while most retail investors are unaware or simply care about the fees given the massive rally in the sector they will become far more pricesensitive as the market matures the inexorable trend in financial services is towards lower and lower transaction costs and coinbase which faces stiff competition from a slew of competitors is sure to feel margin pressure as the year proceeds insiders sell most of their allowed holdings little wonder then the insiders dumped as much of their stock as possible on the ipo liquidating nearly billion of their holdings the main venture capital fund union square partners sold billion coinbase founder brian armstrong sold nearly onehalf of his stock holdings and cfo alesia haas sold all her allowed stock on the ipo defenders of the stock have pointed out that the reports of wholesale dumping of positions were misleading given the fact that executive management have millions of stock options available to them but that would only further the point of dilution for public shareholders that would enjoy none of the capital raise were those options to be exercised the pairs trade provides a hedged bet on correction in sector can coinbase run higher in the upcoming months despite its gross overvaluation yes but almost impossible to imagine a jump in coin stock without a contemporaneous rally in bitcoin which is why the pairs trade should serve a hedge in the trade on the other hand if bitcoin corrects the decline in coin is likely to be far steeper given its overvaluation and vulnerability to erosion of margins from increased competition in the space

2021/4/19 13:00,1,tether launches on hermez rollup as ethereum starts falling behindethereum is starting to lose ground to its competitors for usdt usage and hermez may help to fix that tether usdt has now launched on hermez network an ethereum scalability solution based on the zkrollup concept rollups provide a way of batching or transactions to lighten the load on the ethereum network the key to rollups is the concept of data availability which means that the state data of the rollup is always fully available onchain in practice this means that the ethereum network knows the token balances of all user accounts on the hermez rollup after every transaction and this knowledge can be used to rapidly withdraw funds and distribute them to their new owners in the event of malfunctions zkrollups can be considered as separate that are entirely reliant on the layerone network for security through the use of zksnarks the hermez rollup publishes regular proofs to the ethereum network that verify its correctness due to the succinct property of snarks the underlying data can be almost arbitrarily large while the proof will remain constant in size this makes it perfect for scalability applications as the ethereum network is able to conclusively prove that the network is working as intended with just a fraction of the data that the rollup itself processed by launching usdt on hermez tether hopes to alleviate the pressure on ethereum gas fees where the tether contract is consistently among the highest gas users as fees for token transfers consistently stay above on ethereum with exchanges upping their withdrawal charges in response the market has significantly diversified on its tether usage transferred value in usdt on ethereum tron and omni bitcoin source coinmetrics tether on network has reached parity with ethereum in terms of value transferred a significant achievement for tron and a source of concern for ethereum supporters arguably the most significant contributing factor to rise is the support from a number of exchanges such as binance huobi okex and many others that are traditionally associated with asia and asian traders whatever users may think of tron few can argue with its low fees and significant acceptance hermez provides an ethereumnative alternative to tron though it adds to omg plasma which so far seems to have failed to gain significant traction hermez can currently be accessed by using metamask binding to the ethereum wallet transacting on the network requires performing a deposit transaction from the ethereum main chain after which the funds become available on the rollup however without a meaningful number of possible destinations for the funds hermez risks getting stifled by competition from other sidechains and layerone networks the hermez team is fully aware of this predicament and is working to integrate with as many exchanges as possible but it remains to be seen whether its efforts will be successful

2021/4/19 13:24,1,weekend collapse for bitcoin instead of the traditional rallybitcoin began a steep decline on sunday morning falling from to in a very short period the price drop led to the liquidation of billion worth of positions the selloff on the crypto market at the weekend was akin to a the total capitalisation of the crypto market collapsed by during the day but at some point before the rebound the scale of the fall reached instead of a weekend rally the market showed the most pronounced readiness for a trend reversal in recent times of course the market was divided into optimists and pessimists the first considers the drawdown as a great opportunity to buy the asset on the decline the latter believe that direct listing was the final stage of the bull rally and in the future we have chances to see a new prolonged decline of the crypto market hard to pinpoint any main reason for the sudden fall as often happens a number of different factors came together to form a perfect storm there was a dramatic drop in hash rate due to a power outage in xinjiang region the power returned but an unpleasant feeling remained as market participants once again realised the vulnerability of the entire system because of the drop in the bitcoin hash rate the average transaction fee exceeded something not seen since it seems the theory that the price of an asset follows the hash rate has been confirmed the fall of the crypto market could also be influenced by rumours that the u.s regulator may initiate an investigation into certain financial institutions that are suspected of laundering funds through cryptocurrencies the main question that worries all market participants without exception regardless of whether they are optimists or pessimists is what exactly has happened now is it really a good opportunity to enter the market at a big discount or is it time to aggressively sell your assets the weekend rally is thought to reflect the mood of the retail sector so everyone will be waiting for the beginning of the workweek as institutional investors will have their say will large capital see the collapse in cryptocurrencies as a good opportunity to open additional positions first of all it is worth remembering that institutional investors are not cryptoenthusiasts no one in the realm of big money has any emotion about any asset class which is why they are called it will be quite interesting to see if the selloff in the crypto market becomes a trigger for similar decisions regarding the traditional market turning it into some early and a reflection of the transition into a phase

2021/4/23 10:16,1,are cryptocurrencies used by exchanges have long been the subject of controversy mainly over issues related to antimoney laundering controls however michael morel who was the executive director of the central intelligence agency cia recently published an independent report that directly disputes the widespread view of the alleged use of bitcoin by criminals the report concludes that generalizations about the use of bitcoin in illicit financing have been significantly overestimated instead the report states that the use of blockchain technology is a very effective tool in the fight against crime and intelligence gathering research reveals that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are not prevalent in illegal activities as in fact illegal activities in the bitcoin ecosystem are more likely to be more limited than in the traditional banking system in particular the proportion of illegal activities carried out through the traditional intermediaries of the financial system ranges between to of world gdp on the contrary according to the research it turned out that the percentage of illegal transactions through cryptocurrencies is negligible as it is less than while it is constantly decreasing the most interesting finding in fact is that the blockchain ecosystem through artificial intelligence allows us to identify offenders and their delinquent activity thus in essence it can be one of the most important tools of forensic investigation in the effort made to combat illicit financing where perhaps there should be a greater focus is on currency trading between cryptocurrencies and conventional currencies the good news is that cryptos trading platforms are strictly regulated trading platforms follow strict rules designed to protect investors and avoid destabilizing the financial system the rules require a high level of transparency and a guarantee of functional durability one problem however is that given their complex corporate structure determining the regulatory status of trading platforms often proves difficult the problem is the lack of a significant level of transaction regulation the point is that cryptocurrency exchanges play a fundamental role in the overall encryption ecosystem therefore the growing degree of entanglement between encryption funding and contract funding needs to be constantly evaluated however regulators generally focus on combating money laundering aml and due diligence rather than transactions in fact cryptocurrencies are usually regulated for the purpose of money laundering and there are no broader framework governing trading activities given the lack of significant regulation of real trading activity many cryptocurrency exchanges are likely to engage in questionable leverage and wash trading what is needed is to become more and more those who will exercise any form of mitigation against market abuse while the phenomenon of bargaining against customers must eliminated cryptocurrencies are now a major asset class with a nominal value of trillions of dollars there is now a greater willingness of large companies and financial institutions to offer cryptocurrencyrelated services but cryptocurrencies still do not have anyone really responsible for serious issues such as transfers of ownership and trade validation ultimately regulated entities put themselves at significant risk at least until cryptocurrencies are subject to the same regulatory oversight as everyone else

the ahead of the event last friday saw shocks and reverberations in the crypto markets this monday not only might other global markets suffer but there is the potential for seismic activity affecting indonesia especially i hope that i am reading this possibility incorrectly the pull of the planets on the crust could be considerable however and catastrophic natural disaster both at this full moon and the next may also a lunar eclipse is a distinct possibility solar cycle in recent months the known planets have been contained within an arc of degrees arguably creating a on the sun perhaps we should not be surprised that there have been strong solar flares too at least one affecting radio signals but thankfully not knocking out the satellites on which our gps systems rely can you imagine the chaos that an energy blackout would create amongst other difficulties which would be acute what would happen to cryptocurrencies crypto currencies their number now runs into thousands and tracking their launch and trading dates before undertaking the exercise of forecasting is proving a demanding if you have accurate data please forward it whilst some are forecasting their rapid demise i am not one of them the concept of blockchain currency is here and to stay these are early days and yes as saturn and uranus form right angles in i expect governments across the world to at least talk about regulations and restrictions implementing these is another matter though i acknowledge that the threat of this could seriously damage prices midjune this does not alter the fact that investor interest in these has grown exponentially since the jupitersaturn in aquarius cycle began last december with the price especially of bitcoin rising substantially yes the price has also fallen but relative to its position at the start of the year there has been substantial growth in particular bitcoin enjoyed meteoric rise as venus moved through geocentric aries but hit the buffers spectacularly as venus moved into taurus last friday april proved a key date mars arrived at the world axis and opposed the marspluto conjunction of the chart for this currency we should see further turbulent activity on friday before another change of direction to the positive from may gold and silver as suggested in an earlier letter the price of both gold and silver did indeed move upward in recent weeks but turned down as the sun moved into taurus this week could prove volatile i suspect that we might yet see some recovery before may then a short plateau with these prices turning down a little from may then silver moving upwards from saturday may overall those invested in these areas will hopefully be reassured through may and june that these are still wise havens for at least some of their savings equities as in my opening paragraph i do have concerns and be surprised if we see decline at full moon looking ahead you may know that eclipses form a pattern a series of or with definite rhythm the next full moon a lunar eclipse on may on exactly the same date as a lunar eclipse in as then this lunar eclipse is followed by a solar eclipse on june in markets went into downward trend with the index losing over a third of its value between the may and early october of that same year the cosmos tends not to do exact repeats pluto neptune uranus and saturn are now in very different areas of the zodiac nevertheless station on may very close to the eclipse could mark the start of decline sectors yet some companies will buck this trend already certain sectors are showing surprising signs of life as vaccines have developed so too have other advances science it seems is on a roll not just with extraordinary successes on mars but in the development of fabrics and new and renewable energy production investors should be excited this new jupitersaturn cycle is already indicating major advancement as mars moves into leo opposing both planets mid june expect a flurry of young companies to come to market and at good price teaching events etc i have been invited to teach a group of students in turkey my sagittarius moon longs to be travelling to meet them in person and the students in hong kong and taiwan hopefully one day for now it feels good to be developing international connections despite the various restrictions having ended my last full moon letter on such optimistic note at least as far as my health was concerned the following morning he suffered another collapse and was hospitalised as you can imagine this development threw my usual routine into disarray yet again i am delighted to say that he is now back home and recovering well in fact with the assistance of a therapist he even managed to climb the stairs to the landing he been upstairs in over a year uranus

acceptable during the previous bull runs btc bounced off this ema as it continued its parabolic growth hence investors could get to see bitcoin price come to such a crucial support level this time around but for that to happen a decisive daily candlestick close below the simple moving average sma at must occur although the ema could keep falling prices at bay failing to hold above it would likely lead to a downswing to the sma at chart dave the wave a renowned technical analyst in the cryptocurrency community believes that the bearish carries a lot of weight according to the chartist the current bullish cycle resembled the one in when considering the recent price action and the evolution of the moving average convergence divergence macd indicator a steep correction could unfold dave clarified that solid correction does not entail a multiyear bear but it may be needed to maintain uptrend healthy chart several onchain metrics support that a steeper correction is underway for instance the number of daily active addresses interacting with the bitcoin network has been steadily declining over the past few weeks it went from million daily active addresses to roughly million representing a drop such onchain activity suggests that investors could either be booking profits or reallocating their funds which is a bearish sign btc daily active addresses chart moreover mvrv reveals that most of the btc tokens purchased over the past year sit higher than at the time they were acquired the high levels of profit that investors could incur now if they were to sell indicate that a potential spike in profittaking is underway interestingly the recent peak seen in the mvrv coincides with the high of late june which marked a local top at the time similar market reaction to this onchain metric could see bitcoin correct to at least the ema at btc mvrv chart despite the grim worstcase scenario whales continue accumulating more bitcoin at every dip supply distribution chart shows that the number of addresses with btc or more has significantly increased their holdings over the past week these highnetworth individuals acquired roughly btc and now own nearly of the total supply the massive buying pressure behind the flagship cryptocurrency opposes the bearish scenario outlined above calling for a continuation of the uptrend btc supply distribution chart if buyers can manage to push the bitcoin above and hold above this crucial hurdle the bearish scenario will likely be invalidated still investors must pay close attention to the sma at since a decisive close below it will send btc into a tailspin toward the ema at or the sma at

2021/4/30 13:53,1,capital gains tax plan to pull crypto down to earth from the are often multiple causes for an sharp decline but btc which took place on april may be blamed on the biden reported plan to tax capital gains at double the current rate on wealthiest bitcoin is habitually volatile so one probably read too much into a doubledigit swoon in any given week but this might be as good a place as any to reflect upon the possible impact of the united states capital gains taxes and taxes in general upon the future growth of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology could it hinder longterm adoption if so in what ways will the biden plan even reach fruition given the vagaries of u.s politics how too does one explain the minimarket eruption in the face of the mere possibility of more taxes in a single nation what sorts of misperceptions might we be harboring with regard to crypto taxation generally price drop can probably be attributed to a number of factors and rumors chiefly the monthend expiration of future positions which resulted in a liquidation of positions that triggered a markus veith a partner in the audit practice at grant thornton llp and leader of the digital assets practice told cointelegraph there were also reports generally thought to be false that treasury secretary janet yellen was spearheading an effort to impose an capital gains tax rate on cryptocurrencies well as rumors that the u.s treasury was investigating financial institutions for illicit use of cryptocurrencies which the doj would do not the added veith continuing there were also comments about a drop in chinese mining a lot was happening that week david trainer ceo of investment research firm new constructs downplayed the btc price gyrations stating volatility is nothing new for btc and crypto in meanwhile tyler menzer a cpa and doctoral student in accounting at the university of iowa noted the tax news does coincide with the drop it may only be one of many contributing but taxes do matter proposal would put the effective tax rate at above in certain states and would be detrimental to job carlos betancourt cofounder of bkcoin capital in miami told newsweek adding would continue to accelerate the move from states like california and new york to more taxfriendly states like florida and texas that have no state income this is still an early stage in a new administration of course and there is some question whether a doubling of the capital gains on the wealthiest to as proposed will even make it through congress intact or if that rate will eventually be reduced needs to pay for all the stimulus deficits and national debt so very likely you would see a tax increase in the near future whether on capital gains or something else is still to be mazhar wani a pricewaterhousecoopers tax partner in san francisco told cointelegraph however omri marian professor of law at the university of california irvine school of law said that the proposal will unlikely be accepted in its current form democratic majority in congress is just too narrow for marian informed cointelegraph chris weston head of research at the pepperstone group a forex broker said numbers being proposed at this juncture will unlikely pass the senate in its current form and centrist democrats will not back the touted but casting rumors aside if a doubling of the capital gains tax does pass through congress intact would it necessarily mean stormy weather for cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology maybe not nathan goldman assistant professor of accounting at north carolina state university told cointelegraph after consulting with his coauthor on btc taxation matters christina lewellen that the new capital gains taxes are geared to the wealthiest those with more than million in annual income and they would be paid only upon the sale of the digital asset a result it is not clear whether the proposed changes would significantly affect most cryptocurrency still likely do have an effect on bitcoin said menzer continuing we have a lot of prior research on a wide variety of outcomes and aspects of life that are affected by tax rates especially in the financial moreover they could push crypto and blockchain technology in some interesting directions wani for example would expect to see more volatility due to certain investors cashing out at the lower rates but long term you may see more demand for defi applications and other collateralized use cases to create liquidity and avoid triggering what about murmurs surrounding socalled capital gains tax which would be and goldman told cointelegraph do not believe there is strong merit to the rumors of an capital gains tax on a position echoed elsewhere but some still believe that yellen really warmed to crypto own view is yellen fundamentally get weston said continuing to go after digital assets to protect against criminal activity in an asset that leaves a record is particularly because cash is usually favored in such transactions given its untraceability meanwhile trainer added think janet yellen was looking to minimize the speculation in crypto she believes that rampant speculation like what we see in crypto is not healthy for investors or the underlying asset over with regard to the capital gains issue in general menzner commented the extent that higher taxes make it more expensive to use cryptocurrency or adopt it for new uses it will be a however he added could also accelerate the use of stablecoins for certain cryptocurrency projects as they are designed to minimize price fluctuations and thus minimize any gain or loss from a tax often see tax as the controlling decision of whether to exit a position but it may drive when an exit occurs for example if any corresponding losses should be harvested when holding periods are met paul beecy tax services partner at grant thornton llp told cointelegraph does ustax policy matter globally to what extent though is this all just a u.s issue does it really even matter in singapore or france what happens in the u.s with regard to tax policy especially for a globally purchased and held asset like bitcoin advantage is key according to wani who added matters if other countries follow similar policies for also he believes other countries may try to become more competitive by offering incentives i.e less taxation to attract more talent and businesses from this growing industry to their only thing i can definitively say on how much u.s tax policy affects crypto is that we added menzer but policy can cause real changes in cryptoexchange many global exchanges do not allow u.s residents and citizens to trade for example thanks to u.s policy effectively separating nonu.s traders from u.s traders which slightly breaks down the idea that bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies are uniformly it matters said marian because you are a u.s taxpayer you owe u.s taxes on your crypto trades no matter how you make them it may be more difficult for the irs to enforce if you hold your assets with a foreign custodian but if you cheat on purpose you care very much about a change in tax what does seem clear is the lack of clarity with regard to taxes and cryptocurrencies starting with the common misperception that you do not need to pay taxes on crypto according to goldman still need to pay taxes on the appreciation of your cryptocurrency assets for example if you bought a single bitcoin on jan for and used that bitcoin to buy a tesla on april value you owe capital gains taxes on the no hard and fast rules more problematic still there is no standard tax treatment for all cryptocurrency uses as beecy told cointelegraph digital currency is held the by individual retail investors as a capital asset the tax rules on buying and selling it are reasonably understood and the capital gains tax that applies ought to impact digital currency transactions in a manner very similar to other financial capital but when by contrast digital currency is structured as part of more complex transactions mimics other and more esoteric financial instruments like derivatives nfts and certain security tokens then the tax rules on those digital currency transactions are not really said beecy all in all last price gyrations might have been an overreaction to some preliminary tax plans but this response was probably predictable given that is obviously a major grey that begets anxiety as weston noted as seen many times of late the market sells first thinks about it and calmer heads generally taxation of course is a serious business and even if doubling of the capital gains tax only directly impacts the wealthiest history teaches that taxes can have a leveraged impact on longterm growth so one needs to pay attention taxation is a form of regulation and the mere fact that discussions like this are taking place in only year of existence may provide some confidence arguably that the u.s is not going to ban or attempt to cryptocurrencies indeed the net effect could be an adoption as people feel more submitted menzer

2021/5/1 19:09,1,what are bitcoin mixers and why do exchanges ban them one of the original allures of cryptocurrency is the narrative that using them provides the sender or recipient anonymously but this is a common misconception within the reality bitcoin btc and many other cryptocurrencies are easily traceable.proof of this came earlier this week when on april u.s authorities arrested the mastermind of bitcoin fog a darknetbased btc mixing service authorities were able to capture the operator after analyzing ten years of blockchain data.one doesnt need to be a forensic analyst to know that every single transaction is tied up to addresses on the blockchain and that they will stay there forever while government agencies cannot determine the ip address or personal data from the address these coins usually end up being used for products or service payments this is the trail that leads back to the sender and recipient in the case of bitcoin fog law enforcement was able to identify server hosting expenses paid using digital currency bitcoin mixing services such as bitcoin fog allow users to mix their coins with other users making it almost impossible to detect the destination addresses this obfuscates the ties between the inputs and output addresses providing a better level of privacy.example of a mixing transaction source tarushtechmediummixing services are offered in a wide range of methods including fully centralized solutions where trust is required to coinjoin mixers which depend on a large group of users to self cooperate and act simultaneously theres even the possibility of trading on decentralized exchanges dex to virtually eliminate any possible tracing.mixers do present a few riskscentralized mixers offer the obvious single point of failure problem even if one trusts that the entity is using multisig addresses if the service is willing to share its data or has been breached their users will lose their privacy.coinjoin solved this problem by combining the inputs of multiple users into a single transaction the service will then take those coins craft them into a transaction and have each participant sign before broadcasting it to the network these transactions are then merged into one and each user gets the original quantity in return however no one can see the origin of those coins not even the entity that merges the transaction.even though coinjoin isnt exactly untraceable it provides plausible deniability as no one can point out which entity owns each output the larger the number of participants the higher the degree of deniability.wasabi wallet coinjoin function screen capture source wasabiwalletsome cryptocurrency users also require anonymity for sending tokens to their wallets and wasabi wallet has long been used for its embedded coinjoin functionalities while its infrastructure is technically centralized its design assures that the operators cannot deanonymize users or steal any funds at the moment the wasabi wallet is only available for desktop solutions so as is the case with anything in cryptocurrency beware of clones a similar service is provided by samourai wallet which also offers a chaumian coinjoin mixing service called whirlpool to achieve a fullprivacy solution users have to connect the samourai wallet to their own full bitcoin node however it does offer desktop and mobile versions.even though these mixing services arent illegal in most jurisdictions some exchanges and services might refuse users linked to addresses associated with coin mixing activities as more people realize the importance of achieving a certain degree of privacy for selfprotection the fewer incentives companies will have to deny their clients to use mixers.the views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of cointelegraph.com every investment and trading move involves risk you should conduct your own research when making a decision
